# [RDS - 2425 Task #4] - Stateful Firewall

In this task we will develop a Stateful Firewall applying Bloom Filters by using P4 Registers. This type of firewall keeps track of active connections and makes filtering decisions based on the state of a connection rather than just individual packets. Bloom Filters are a probabilistic data structure that efficiently checks membership in a set with minimal memory usage. It can determine whether an element might be in a set (with some false positives) or definitely isnâ€™t. Registers in P4 are stateful memory elements that can store values across different packet processing stages, unlike standard P4 tables, which are stateless.

## Objectives
- Learn about TCP and UDP header.
- Learn how to store state in a P4 program.
- Learn how to implement Bloom Filters using P4 Registers.
- Create a Stateful Firewall that blocks incoming TCP and UDP traffic that was not initiated by the host behind the firewall (h2).

## Topology
`h1 -- r1 -- r2+firewall -- h2`

## Task Description
### **Create the Topology**
- Everything is given. `mininet/task4-topo.py`
### **P4 l3 switch for R1**
- Everything is given. `p4/l3switch.p4`
### **P4 l3 switch + firewall for R2**
#### copy l3switch.p4
```bash
cp p4/l3switch.p4 p4/l3switch_firewall.p4
```
#### TCP and UDP Header
- Define TCP and UDP headers in `p4/l3switch_firewall.p4`.
#### TCP and UDP Parsers
- Define the parser for TCP and UDP in `p4/l3switch_firewall.p4`.
### Ingress
- Declare two Registers (Bloom Filter) with 4096 bit in length(entries) and 1 bit width (entry size) 
- Declare two 32 bit variables that will work as indexes for the Bloom Filter.
- Declare two 1 bit variables to collect the values of the Bloom Filter.
- Declare an Action that computes the hashes, define which protocol fields will be used to compute the hashes. Use 2 hash algorithms for the Bloom Filter, one for each Register.
- Define the needed logic, in the control block (apply), so when a packet arrives from port 2 (port connected to host 2), we compute the hashes and write on the Bloom Filter, otherwise, compute the hashes and read from the bloom filters checking if the stream/flow exist. Block the traffic if it does not exist.


### Compile P4

```
```bash
p4c-bm2-ss --std p4-16  p4/l2switch.p4 -o json/l2switch.json
```

## Debugging Tips

Here are some useful commands to help troubleshoot and verify your topology:

### 1. **Wireshark (Packet Capture)**

### 2. **ARP Table Inspection**
   - **Command:** `arp -n`
   - **Usage:** Check the ARP table on any Mininet host to ensure proper IP-to-MAC Default gateway resolution.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     mininet> h1 arp -n
     ```

### 3. **Interface Information**
   - **Command:** `ip link`
   - **Usage:** Display the state and configuration of network interfaces for each host or router.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     mininet> r1 ip link
     ```

### 4. **P4 Runtime Client for Monitoring**
   - **Command:** `sudo ./tools/nanomsg_client.py --thrift-port <r1_port or r2_port>`
   - **Usage:** Interact with the P4 runtime to inspect flow tables and rules loaded on each router.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     sudo ./tools/nanomsg_client.py --thrift-port 9090
     ```

These commands will help you inspect network traffic, verify ARP entries, check interface states, and interact directly with the P4 routers.
